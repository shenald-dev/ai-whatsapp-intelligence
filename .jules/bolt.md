## 2024-03-17 — Refactored group dashboard API to prevent OOM errors and reduce latency

Learning:
The API endpoint that computes group message statistics (`/groups/{group_id}/stats`) previously pulled all message records for a given group into memory to calculate counts in python. In a WhatsApp intelligence monitor handling large volumes of chat data, this would quickly lead to high memory consumption, garbage collection pauses, and eventually out-of-memory errors for groups with thousands of messages.

Action:
Refactored the dashboard API to push all group statistics aggregations (e.g., analyzed counts, sentiment breakdown, classification detection) down to the PostgreSQL database level using optimized `GROUP BY` and `CASE` aggregation queries (`func.sum(case(...))`). Ensure future metrics queries follow this pattern, shifting computational weight off the API nodes and taking advantage of SQL optimizations.
